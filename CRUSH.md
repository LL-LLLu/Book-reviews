# Conversation Summary

This document summarizes the key activities and context from our conversation about the Book Review App.

## 1. Project Overview & Analysis
- **Purpose**: We determined the application is a full-stack book review platform where users can search for books, write reviews, and manage their profiles.
- **Technology Stack**:
    - **Frontend**: Next.js (TypeScript, React), Tailwind CSS, NextAuth.js
    - **Backend**: Express.js (Node.js)
    - **Database**: MongoDB
    - **Deployment**: Docker Compose, designed for AWS EC2.

## 2. Public Deployment Plan
We outlined a comprehensive strategy to deploy the application securely to the public internet.

- **`DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`**: I created this file to document the full deployment process.
- **Key Steps**:
    1.  **Domain & DNS**: Point a custom domain to the server's IP.
    2.  **Server & Firewall**: Provision a Linux server (e.g., AWS EC2) and configure the firewall to allow public traffic only on ports `80` (HTTP) and `443` (HTTPS), while restricting `22` (SSH) and `81` (Proxy Admin).
    3.  **Secure Configuration**: Create a `.env` file with strong, unique secrets for the database, JWT, and NextAuth. Update all `localhost` URLs to use the public domain.
    4.  **Reverse Proxy with SSL**: Set up Nginx Proxy Manager in a separate Docker container to handle SSL termination (HTTPS) and route traffic to the main application containers.
    5.  **Launch Order**: First, launch the main app to create the shared network. Then, launch the proxy, which connects to that existing network.

## 3. Database Administration
- **Problem**: The user encountered a "needs authentication" error when trying to update a user's role in the database using `docker exec`.
- **Solution**: I provided the correct, authenticated `mongosh` command, which includes the username, password, and authentication database.

### Correct `mongosh` command:
This command correctly authenticates with the MongoDB container to perform administrative tasks.
```bash
# Export the password from .env first for security
export $(grep '^MONGO_PASSWORD=' /path/to/project/.env)

# Run the command using the variable
docker exec book-review-db mongosh bookreview \
  -u admin \
  -p "$MONGO_PASSWORD" \
  --authenticationDatabase admin \
  --eval "db.users.updateOne({email: 'user@example.com'}, {\$set: {role: 'admin'}})"
```
